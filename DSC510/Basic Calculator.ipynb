    "// Desc: This program is a limited use basic calculator that either 1) performs a calculation using 2 numbers or 2) calculates an average of 2 or more numbers.\n",
    "// Usage: The program prompts the user to 1) Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division using 2 numbers; 2) Calculate an average of 2+ numbers; or 3) Quit, which ends the program. Both calculator functions are called by the main program via a function. Each function uses a loop, prompts the user for the input they wish to use in the calculation, performs the calculation so long as the input is valid, and provides error messages for invalid input, followed by renewed prompts to obtain the desired input. After each calculation is performed, the user has the option to perform either type of calculation or quit the program."
