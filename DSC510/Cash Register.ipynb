    "// Desc: This program functions as a rudimentary cash register for 10 fast food items with fixed prices.\n",
    "// Usage: The program uses class methods and standalone functions. It 1) displays a welcome message; 2) prompts the user to select an individual item, then looping to allow unlimited additions of individual items to the order; 3) aggregates and displays the item count by 1 for each menu selection; 4) adds the selection's price to a running total; and 5) allows the user to end the order, which a) prints the final item count, amount due, and a final message.
